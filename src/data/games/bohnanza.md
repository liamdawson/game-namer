# en-US

You are a bean farmer. As the game progresses, you must plant your beans in the
order you drew them, which can force you to clear your fields before they're
ready. However you can trade with (or donate to) your colleagues to clear your
stock, so long as you don't give them what they really need! Only your wits
will enable your meteoric rise to cocoa bean capone, but there can only be one
winner. Will you reap a veritable Bohnanza, or will you be forgotten as one of
history's has-beans?
